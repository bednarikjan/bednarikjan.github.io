<p> Thanks to the course <emph>Image processing</emph> run by my faculty during summer semester 2014/2015 I got the chance to choose among a couple of tempting projects to work on during the semestr. As I had been impressed by the Google's new approach for stabilizing videos, which they eventually embedded as an internal tool to the YouTube portal, I had decided to assign for a project with a single requirement - design and implement the tool for video stabilization. The resulting tool written in C++ implements two different methods and achieves pretty interesting results.</p>
