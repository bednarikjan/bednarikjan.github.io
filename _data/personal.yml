  bio: I am a student of Computer graphics and multimedia Master study programme at the Faculty of Information Technology at Brno University of Technology. During the last few years I found myself amazed by what the computers can autonomously do if given the right perception hardware and algorithms and how they can help or even substitute human in the certain applications. Therefore I decided to dive a bit in the problematic of computer vision, machine learning and robotics and try to understand what it takes to make a really intellgient machine. But what is most important, it is fun :-) For my professional resume please feel free to visit my LinkedIn profile.
